## 🌿 About Me
My goal is building mental healthcare application through **computer vision**, **large language models**, and **multi-modal architectures** for the well-being of the human race.  
My academic journey—from Yonsei University to UC Berkeley—strengthened my skills in **Data mining**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**, and I’m currently preparing for **MS in Computer Science (Fall 2026)**.
